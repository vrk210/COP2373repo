This program allows the user to enter a name, account number, amount, and interest rate, and will output the balances and interest amount.

Variables Created:
self.amount
self.name
self.account_number
self.interest_rate
account
balance
interest

Functions Created:
__init__(self, amount =0.0)
__init__(self,  name, account_number, amount, interest rate)
add(self, amount)
subtract(self, amount)
adjust_interest_rate(self, new_rate)
get_balance(self)
calculate_interest(self, days)
__str__(self)
test_bank_acct()

Program Steps:
The Program creates a class ‘Money’ which initializes an instance of money with optional amount and sets self.amount to amount. Then adds give amount to self.amount and subtracts given amount from self.amount if amount > self.amount.
The program then uses a class called ‘Bank Acct’ inheriting from money the add and subtract functions adding specific functions that manage a bank acct using ‘adjust_interest_rate’, ‘get_balance’, and ‘calculate_interest’.
The program then runs test_bank_acc() to use these functionalities, creating an instance of a bank account class and testing the methods printing the according results.
