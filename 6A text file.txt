This program prompts the user to enter a phone number, SSN, and a zip code. The program then takes the input and checks it against a few valid, normally used formats and prints whether the user entered responses matches the given formats.

Variables Used:
pattern
phone_number
ssn
zip_code

Functions Created:
validate_phone_number
validate_ssn
validate_zip_code
main

Program Steps:
1. The program prompts the user for a phone number, SSN, and zip code.
2. The program then runs validate_phone_number, comparing the user entered phone number to the given common formats of phone numbers and converts the either successful or unsuccessful match to a Boolean value, and prints either "The phone number is valid" or "The phone number is invalid" depending on whether the Boolean returns true or false.
3. The program then runs validate_ssn, comparing the user entered SSN to the given format of SSNs and converts the either successful or unsuccessful match to a Boolean value, prints either "The social security number is valid" or "The social security number is invalid" depending on whether the Boolean returns true or false.
4. The program then runs validate_zip_code, comparing the user entered zip code to the given format of zip codes and converts the either successful or unsuccessful match to a Boolean value, prints either "The zip code is valid" or "The zip code is invalid" depending on whether the Boolean returns true or false.
5. Main is then called to execute each function and print the corresponding results.
