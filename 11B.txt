This program determines the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the nearest angle, in degrees, and the length of the adjacent side.

Variables Created:
angle_degrees
Adjacent
angle_radians
Hypotenuse

Functions Created:
calculate_hypotenuse
Main

Program Steps:
1. The program prompts the user for both the nearest angle and the length of the adjacent side.
2. The program converts the angle from degrees to radians then uses the formula: hypotenuse/cos(theta) to calculate the hypotenuse
3. The program then outputs the hypotenuse.
